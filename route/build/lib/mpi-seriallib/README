Location to build the MCT mpi-serial library which is a MPI implementation that only works with one task

The mpi-serial configure script must be run from the main mizuRoute Makefile in order to create the
build files in this directory.


NOTE: After build files are created, SRCDIR is a required option to be given to the Makefile

so....

gmake SRCDIR=../../../../cime/src/externals/mct/
